                    <p>I have consistently been playing competitive pokemon for a few years now. While our battle simulator has some key differences from the original pokemon battles, I think it is a good project to show our coding skills. My favorite pokemon is Shuckle and unfortunately we couldn’t include it due to its vast superiority.</p>

                    <h3>Chase</h3>
                    <p>Ever since I was a child, I always wanted to be the very best, like no one ever was. Staying focused on something I’m passionate about it easy, especially Pokemon. My favorite pokemon is Charmeleon. While I’m writing this, I’m actually in Seattle getting a pokemon themed tattoo! I had a lot of fun with this group, and am excited to work again with them in the future. Hope you enjoy some battles!</p>

                    <p>I used to collect Pokemon cards when I was younger and play the games although I was never really that good at them (except for Pokemon Snap, I was great at that). I've since lost interest, but working on this project feels like a shout out to little me from adult me! Oh, and my favorite Pokemon is Mew. </p>

                    <p>I don't have alot of knowledge of pokemon, nor alot of experience with them. As a child, I owned a small binder with cards in it, but after they were stolen, I lost interest. I did play Pokemon Moon all the way through once, and enjoyed it. My favorite pokemon is Raichu. I was initially daunted by the scope of this projects, but working for a bit, I realized that we might not only finish, but will also manage to get some extra features in place.</p>
